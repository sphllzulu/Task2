Employee Registration Activity - README
This document outlines the functionalities and design considerations for an Employee Registration Activity web application.

Features:

Employee Management:
CRUD Operations:
Create: Users can add new employees with details like name, email, phone number, image, position, and a unique ID.
Read: Users can view a list of all employees.
Update: Users can edit existing employee details.
Delete: Users can delete employees from the list.
Search: Users can search for employees by their ID.
Employee Status:
The application allows for filtering employees by their current status (active or left the organization).
Data Persistence:
Uses local storage to store and retrieve employee data, ensuring information remains persistent across page refreshes.
Responsiveness:

The application should be designed to adapt and display correctly on various screen sizes (desktop, mobile, tablets).

Imagine a web page with the following sections:

Search Bar: A text input field where users can enter an employee ID to search.
Employee List: A table displaying information like employee image, ID, name, email, phone number, position, and status (active/left).
This table should be responsive and adjust layouts for smaller screens.
Employee Status Filter: Buttons or options to filter the employee list by active or left the organization.
Add Employee Form: A form with fields for entering new employee details (name, email, phone, image upload, position, and a unique ID generation option).
Actions: Each employee entry in the list should have buttons for edit and delete functionalities.
